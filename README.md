## About 

Mean Mugs is a paired-programming web application with basic CRUD functionality. Users can select coffee based on roast-level preference as well as customize their own coffee and add it to existing selections. Main website was built using HTML using CSS and Bootstrap for styling and vanilla JS for functionality. 

## USER Features

- Search for a specific coffee by roast level or coffee name.

- View "All" coffees available on our online menu.

- Search for all coffee options by roast level.

- Add their unique coffee creation to existing online menu. 



**Bonus Challenge**

- Allow the user to add new coffees to the page:
    Create another form on the page that has an input for the coffee name, and
    a select to choose the coffee roast. When the form is submitted, the new
    coffee should appear on the page. (*Note that any new coffees you add will
    be lost when you refresh the page, for an extra challenge, research
    how `localStorage` works and see if you can find a way to persist the data*)
